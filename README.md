# VisualisationNotebooks
Repo for random assortments of jupyter notebooks that I have used for visualising different datasets. Some of these notebooks are a little big for Github to render, so if you want to view them download and run jupyter notebook :)


## Contents:

- Bottle data comparison: A short analysis on why CTD data did not match the collected bottle data when on a survey in Macquarie harbour. Deduced from analysis that bottle sample depths were likely recorded incorrectly, most likely due to swell and the small boat heaving.

- Calculate DO in ppm: Short notebook sent to colleague at UNSW for converting % saturation dissolved oxygen into parts per million

- DO Commission: Lengthy analysis and statistical analysis to verify that new dissolved oxygen analysers are working as well as the existing instrument before being commissioned for use on RV Investigator

- SOTS data with MU: Short visualisation to compare historical nutrinet data collected at the SOTS mooring site. Added in shaded bands to depict the calculated measurement uncertainty for each sample collected

- Lengthy statistical and modelling analysis of the Hydrochemistry team's pipettes and volumetrics with outputs feeding into the bottom up calculation of measurement uncertainty

- in2019_v05 Triaxus transect overview: Compilation of many sources of data from RV Investigator to provide near realtime visualisations of eddy transects
